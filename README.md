# ModelingSoftware
This repository will hold code for a software that allows users to create their own 3D models. I will have added my own functionality to it to begin with. This is an open source software project and is using the Apache 2.0 License. The sole purpose of this is to allow other people to download this software and if there is a feature that does not exist then they have the ability to change the downloaded source code to fit their needs. Then distribution can be among anyone who would like to use this software (including any modifications) to allow anyone to make the 3D models that they want. As mentioned, in the "Open source licenses: What, which, and why" article, everyone who uses this code is provided with perpetual patents or can make their own copyright statements for their modified version of the source code. This allows for people to still be owners of their own features that they could add to this software and not have to worry about it other people claiming it for their own.
